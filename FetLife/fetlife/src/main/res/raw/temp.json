  "about": "#### **Greetings**\r\nI'm Tyler Corsair; a magnificent blend of a **Daddy**, developer, and overall adoration towards the BDSM community as a whole.\r\n\r\nI participate in events, play parties, and meet-ups whenever possible locally in Los Angeles and neighboring cities, as well as organize and host munches.\r\n\r\nI have a passion for providing support, advice, and guidance for those in need within the community and helping newer individuals transition into kink safely and consensual. I also manage [@BDSM][http://fetlife.com/BDSM], an organization built around free education and resources for all.\r\n\r\nYou are always absolutely more than welcome to follow me, although if you send a friend request (and we haven't met or otherwise have close mutual friends), please send me a message just saying hello! Always appreciated.\r\n\r\n#### About\r\n\r\nA corsair is a person of many things; I'm a web developer/designer, as well as have a love for business. My involvement within the kink community is something I adore and and have always been open about it to friends and family. I'm here to explore, make friends, and whatever else interesting comes my way.\r\n\r\nI associate myself as a *switch and sadomasochist* as I enjoy being dominant and the energy it brings, although have a love for being a bottom. I am still exploring my pain threshold, however can safely say it is *very high*. I enjoy being cat-like (neko) in my everyday life, occasionally catching myself meowing at random points.\r\n\r\n##### *While my profile may be **Daddy**, I prefer to only be called that by my submissive. Whenever possible, please address me by Tyler or Corsair.*\r\n\r\nHappily living in a home with two lovable kittens; Seraphina and our kitten, Jiji. I am happily taken and very content! If you wish to play with her or I, please message either one of us and let us know beforehand. We are both very welcoming and open to many forms of play, so just let us know.\r\n\r\nIn August 2016, I began the notion of [https://fetlife.com/users/5386957/posts/3917972][discovery of my own identity] and consider myself genderfluid. All pronouns are fine at this time, as long as they are not demeaning.\r\n\r\n#### BDSM \u0026 Kink [https://fetlife.com/users/5386957/posts/3695520][(View my limits)] [(BSPI Test)][https://fetlife.com/users/5386957/posts/3585668] [(BDSM Test)][https://fetlife.com/users/5386957/posts/3585727]\r\nFrom an early age, I've always had a really lewd and deviant view on life before I actually dove far into it. I was exposed to sexuality quite early as a child and my interest in it grew from there.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, I began my dive into the kink community and began to attend dungeons and other events with my sub/little. After witnessing the beauty of the community and the artistic view of scenes with a splash of sexuality; I've been trying to improve myself as a dominant and go on from there. Currently, I'm exploring my love for sensation and fire play along with improving my skills with rope.\r\n\r\nAs aforementioned, I assist the community at times by providing support, assistance, and advice for those in need, as well as volunteering at dungeons whenever possible. Alongside my dear, I help manage the groups and munches for [Torrance (and neighboring towns)][https://fetlife.com/groups/99020], [https://fetlife.com/groups/16434][Lakewood (Long Beach)], [Santa Clarita][https://fetlife.com/groups/140004].",

The pleasures of a clinging catsuit, the constriction of a corset, the heady heights of high heels, the luxury of a latex hood, the beauty of blowups, the geil of gasmasks, the taboo of tubes,\" a taste for the bizarre.\r\n \r\nThe sensuality of wearing rubber does not compare to anything else I have encountered. Slipping into latex that clings like a second skin to every inch of my body displays it with elegance and makes me feel both exposed and protected. My pleasures include total enclosure, inflatables, deflatables, bondage, furniture, theatre, costumes and role play. \r\n\r\nI enjoy art, music, food, film, travel, fast cars, sailing, laughing often \u0026 living well.
